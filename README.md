# Word-Game
Major Project of Fundamentals of Computer Science 2 using the language Java

This was the first major project of this class, that involved a lot of abstract coding. In this game, once the user runs the program, a series of scrambled words will come on the screen. They will start at the top and make their way to the bottom. The goal of the game is to ensure that no word touches the bottom. As illustrated in the video, once the user starts typing a word, it turns green to indicate that the user has to finish typing it. Once they finish, the next word has to be typed and so on. In the video, this is all shown while the word on the left side, I did not type at all. It eventually hit the bottom, indicating that the game was over. This project involved making a lot of classes to ensure that the right action was being taken every time the user would press the key word.
