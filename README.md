# Word-Game
Major Project of Fundamentals of Computer Science 2 using the language Java

This was the first main project of this class, which had us using abstract code to create a word-typing game. The objective is to type the scrambled words that spawn at the top of the screen before they reach the bottom of the screen when the code runs. The word becomes green as the user starts typing it, signaling that they have to finish typing it before going on to the next. This is considered an "active" word. All the other words are red as shown in the video, to signify "inactive" words. The game ends when a word touches the bottom, in which there is a game over screen. In the video, this is all shown while the word on the left side, I did not type at all. It eventually hit the bottom, indicating that the game was over. When developing this project, it was necessary to develop multiple classes, including abstract classes to handle different game conditions and user inputs based on what they are typing. I gained knowledge on how to create specific features (handling keyboard input) and provide flexibility for certain behaviors using abstract classes. I now have a better understanding of many concepts including how to reuse code to make the code more efficient.
